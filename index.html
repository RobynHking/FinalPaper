  <br> What Genre Would You Assume This Game Is Based Off Of Audio?</br>


  
  <br><p> In the game <b>Poppy Playtime</b>, the player returns to the Playtime co. factory, to see that many of its toys, in including its mascot have turn into monsters that roam the factory.

  
Now the player must navigate through the factory to escape, whilst uncovering the story behind why the factory closed, and what happened to the other workers.</p></br>

<br><center>This is the Mascot of Playtime.Co, <b>Huggy Wuggy</b>, and the game's first antagonist.</center></br>

<p><center>In the first chapter there is a hair raising sequence where the main charcater is running from Huggy, inside the vents of the factory.
  This sequecne i believe translates well to the topic of <b>Affect</b> and <b>Emotion</b>. Huggy suddenly appears which leads to a chase, despite seeming too big for this 
  environment, Huggy is able to follow the player closely. </center></p>

<p><center>In this sequence when Huggy first appears, the immediate gut reaction is to run, but the emotion of the game comes along with the twists and turns of the vents.
The goal of this sequence is to escape and detour Huggy Wuggy, so the player must act quickly in order to survive this situation. They must also use the terrain to their advantage
and not become distracted. </center></p>


<p><br><center>On another topic, <b>"fort-da"</b> is also present within the game. If the player is killed, they are able to respawn. even though this feature is prevelent in many games, 
part of the lore of the game is that ominous messages appear such as these:</center></br></p>

<p style="color:white">This is a paragraph.</p>

<center>These messgaes are ideal examples of 'fort-da" as this respawn element gives the player control over how the navigate the game, and chances to learn from their mistakes. Furthermore, 
  these death messages, imply that respanwing or coming back to life is necessary to the actual storyline, and make this action feel less truamatic almost like a cycle that is meant 
  to be repeated.</center>
  
<p><center>Poppy Playtime also falls into the analog horror genre, the game utilizes distoted or "grainy" audios. Specifically, with old VHS tapes that enchnace the game story and gameplay 
    overall. The tapes are of past employees and staff of the Playtime Co. Factory. I believe this features give the game a "barthes-esque" effect where the user beomces emersed in the game
    and can it can feel more real. Additonally, the environemnt of the game consisting of childlike drawings and primary colored tiles, makes the environment seem real.</center></p>
